# Bookify

The E-Commerce Website for Book Sales is a user-friendly online platform that allows customers to browse, purchase, and manage both physical and eBooks seamlessly. The platform is designed to provide a smooth shopping experience while offering powerful tools for administrators to manage inventory, orders, and user access effectively.


## Demo

**Note**: The website may feel a bit slow as it's using a free PostgreSQL database, which can cause some lag. Additionally, the ebook upload and delete features are disabled since they are managed through AWS S3 to avoid S3 charges i hvae disabled it. The book management features (add, edit, delete) are also disabled to prevent unnecessary changes in demo, but please note that these only disabled but they work just fine ðŸ™ƒ.
