## Demo

**Note**: The website may feel a bit slow as it's using a free PostgreSQL database and free hosting service, which can cause some lag(a log actuallly) but it's not slow it work fine. Additionally, the ebook upload and delete features are disabled since they are managed through AWS S3 to avoid S3 charges i hvae disabled it. The book management features (add, edit, delete) are also disabled to prevent unnecessary changes in demo, but please note that these only disabled but they work just fine ðŸ™ƒ.
